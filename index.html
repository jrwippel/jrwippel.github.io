      <h3>Featured Project</h3>
      <h4>Law Firm Time Tracking System</h4>

      <p>
        A web-based system actively used by a real law firm to track
        lawyers' working hours, support accurate client billing,
        and provide full visibility into how the firm's time and
        resources are allocated.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system helps identify profitability issues, supports
        monthly billing processes, and enables data-driven decisions
        regarding fixed-fee and hourly-based clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built with ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and hosted on Microsoft Azure,
        focusing on long-term maintainability and real production needs.
